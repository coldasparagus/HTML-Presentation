HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT - AN OVERVIEW

* What is a web server?

* What is a web browser?

* What is a "dot-html" file?

It is NOT HTML.

* Well, what is it then?

It's a file in HTML format, containing text from the author, HTML tags
(including references to other URLs, such as links to click or inline
images), and it optionally (but usually) contains either links to
other CSS and JavaScript files, or contains CSS "directives"
[instructions to the web browser about fonts, colors, etc.] and/or
JavaScript code "inline" [stuck into the HTML code in various places
using certain HTML tags].

* If that isn't HTML, then what *is* HTML?

HTML is a name for a file format, somewhat like "*.txt" or "*.doc".
It stands for HyperText Markup Language and the format is published by
an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium, often known as
"W3C".  It's an open format, not only specified by one company.

* OK, then what is hypertext?  And what is markup?

Hypertext is a word for a kind of text file, a normal text file you
can edit with Notepad, that contains whatever you would like, such as
a description of a company, or your own personal thoughts, etc.  But
it's different from a normal text file since it contains "markup" and
it contains "hyperlinks" to other text files or image files, either
local on your computer, or located on any computer in the world which
is making them available with a web server.

The "markup" parts are instructions to the web browser [NOT! the web
server] which tells the browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, etc.) how to
display the text you wrote on the screen of the browser when the file
is displayed.  Markup is found within angle brackets in the file
(greater and less-than signs), and and individual piece of markup is
called a "tag".

So now a file ending in ".html" I will now call an HTML file, since
it's understood that it is *in* HTML format, and also that it itself
is not *the* HTML format, which as I said is defined by W3C.

[[[So, HTML defines a file containing hypertext, text which references
other hypertext, as I said.  And a markup language "marks up" the
hypertext so that the web browser knows how to display it to the user.]]]

* That is a lot.  Is that it?

No, it isn't.  Writing a modern web page is very complicated because
it's usually necessary to use other languages (sometimes several
different ones) along with HTML itself to produce what the user sees
and interacts with on the screen.  It's a lot different from someone
sitting down and writing a long computer program in a single
programming language, which does the job the company needs.

* You said "hypertext markup language".  How is it a language?

It is NOT a programming language.  It's not like Visual Basic, C#
["see sharp"], and other languages which are called "procedural"
languages.  Like I said, it's a markup language, used to add
instructions about how to display the text and images, etc.

A procedural language can be used for instance to add up all the
numbers you type in and print out the answer.  The code can loop back,
make decisions with "IF" statements, store data in variables, etc.
HTML does not do that.  That's why it's necessary to add JavaScript to
HTML to accomplish procedural programming within a web page.  More
later, now back to markup.

* What is CSS?

"CSS" is another World Wide Web (WWW) acronym!  It stands for
"Cascading Style Sheets".  It's a way of separating the presentation
of your HTML document from its content.  I don't think this will make
sense until I provide some background information.

HTML tries to keep the presentation, that is, how an HTML document
finally appears on the screen, from the structure and the content of
the document.  That's the words, the pictures, the section breaks, and
other elements of the HTML which don't have to do with how it appears
on the screen.

One of the foundations of the HTML aproach to document formatting is
seperating the "presentation" of a document from the actual content of
the document.  This is in contrast to the approach used by most word
processors, like Microsoft Word.  With a word processor, the way that
you format your document is mixed in with the words and images you
type in.  If, later, you decide that you want to change the font for
all of the section headings, you may have trouble if you had put in
the formatting manually along with your text.  You would have to go
through the document and change every section heading individually.

But, if you used a format built in to Word for your section headings,
then you could just change the font for *that format*, and all of your
section headings would change.  So in this case, since you thought
ahead and made sure to separate the presentation (the built-in format
for the section headings) from the content, the change you wanted to
make was easy and not a lot of labor.

Cascading Style Sheets are an implementation of that concept, for HTML
documents.  They allow you to almost completely separate the
presentation of your web page from the content, text and pictures,
which is in it.

* What is a style sheet?
* What is a style?
* What about cascading?

* And finally, what about JavaScript?

JavaScript is in fact a true multipurpose programming language.  So it
*is* like Visual Basic, C#, and many other languages.  People really
criticized it when it came out in the 1990s.  It was developed by
NetScape, a famous early Internet company.  Even though it has the
word "Java" in the name, it has nothing to do with the Java
programming language which was made by a different company and wasn't
intended for the Web, really.  But time passed, and programmers found
out that there were some ways to write JavaScript programs that made
them as powerful as any other programming language.

I said that now JavaScript is as powerful any other language.  But, as
a language, it has a crucial difference which sets it apart.
JavaScript was intended to be used only within a web page.

Unlike, say, a program in C# or Visual Basic, a program in JavaScript
isn't used by running it from the command line or clicking on an icon
in Windows Explorer. [Although this can be done.]  JavaScript runs
*within* the users web browser, when the user is browsing a web page.
The JavaScript program is either "embedded" (inserted within) an HTML
file or it's in it's own file, ending in ".js".  At the time that the
browser loads a page, the JavaScript in the web page is run, like any
other computer program like, say, Visual Basic.

This seems like a huge security problem.  If a user just browses a
page somewhere on the Web, then the JavaScript in that page will run.
What if it's a site that wants to hack into your computer?  

The cure to this potential problem is that JavaScript is run in a
"sandbox" (or like a jail) within the browser.  It can't use any
resources of the computer the browser is running on except by asking
the browser.  So, unless there is some security flaw in the browser,
it's safe to run any JavaScript code from any site anywhere, by
design.
